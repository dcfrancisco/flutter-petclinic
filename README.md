# Flutter Petclinic

A Flutter project inspired by the [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic). This application demonstrates how to build a modern, mobile-friendly version of the Petclinic using Flutter, following clean architecture principles.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A central hub to navigate the application.
- **Find Owner**: Search for pet owners by last name. View details about their pets and visits.
- **Veterinarian Page**: A list of veterinarians with their specialties.
- **Data Stubs**: Currently, the application uses mock JSON data for demonstration purposes, with plans to transition to Firebase-based REST APIs.

## Work in Progress

This project is a **work in progress** and is under active development. Future plans include:

- **Refactoring**: Improve the codebase for better modularity and scalability.
- **Dynamic Data Source**: Transition from JSON stubs to Firebase-based REST APIs.
- **New Features**: Add support for user roles, authentication, and more interactive features.
